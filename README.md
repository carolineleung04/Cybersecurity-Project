# Cybersecurity-Project

Group members: Caroline Leung and Emma Chio

Caroline (12-14): Made the repo

Emma (12-15): Tested and made a virtual box with the Ubuntu operating system

Emma (12-16): Opened virtual box and tried connecting to it through ssh, and researched why it was not working

Emma (Winterbreak): Managed to redirect port of computer to be able to ssh into virtual box as well as download the operating system so that it was fully functional

Emma (1-4): Researched SUID and ways to be able exploit functions with sudo privileges

Emma (1-6): Found a way to be able to add a root user or change the password of root by exploiting a weakness in that the password file is writeable. Made it so that virtual box had that weakness.

Emma (1-7): Researched more about relative pathways
